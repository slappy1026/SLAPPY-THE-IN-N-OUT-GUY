<h1>Nicest Cars Ever</h1>

   <p style= "text-align:center">Learn all about the nicest cars in history!</p>
 



<h2> #10: Aston Martin Valkyerie <h2>
	<img src="http://curiosity.gratis/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ASTON-MARTIN-VALKYRIE.jpg" width=50%>

	<p>All carbon-fiber. There is not one steel part in the Valkyire's structure. The iconic creation will supply a naturally-aspirated V12 specifically to a 1:1 power-to-weight ratio. All that power, exceptionally lightweight.

<h2> #9: Koenigsegg Regera</h2>

	<p>The Agera R has an upgraded fuel and engine management system that allows it to run between 95 Octane and E100 biofuel, or any mix in between. The engine management system senses the fuel mixture and can adjust the engine’s operation ‘on the fly’.
The Agera R’s fuel system has enough flow capacity to generate 1140hp and 1200Nm of torque on E85 and E100 biofuel. As there is less energy content per given volume in these biofuels compared to normal petrol, the fuel system has to manage a flow that is similar to a 2000hp petrol engine, which means that the Agera R’s return-less fuel system had the highest capacity of any car in production at the time.

	<h2>#8 Porshe 918 Spyder</h2>

	<img src="http://press.porsche.com/admin/presspics/787.jpg">  


The 918 Spyder embodies the essence of the Porsche idea: it combines pedigree motor racing technology with excellent everyday utility, and maximum performance with minimum consumption. The task faced by the development team was to create the super sports car for the next decade with a highly efficient and powerful hybrid drive. Developing the car from scratch, appropriately beginning with a sheet of white paper, allowed the team to come up with a no-compromise concept. The entire car was designed around the hybrid drive. The 918 Spyder therefore demonstrates the potential of the hybrid drive to a degree never seen before: the parallel improvement of both efficiency and performance without one being at the cost of the other. This is the idea that has made the Porsche 911 the most successful sports car in the world for 50 years. In short, the 918 Spyder will act as the gene pool for the Porsche sports cars of the future.
The 918 Spyder reveals its close links to motorsport in a variety of ways. It has been designed, developed and produced by Porsche engineers who build race cars, in cooperation with series production specialists. A great deal of insight gained from the development of Porsche race cars for the 24 hours race in Le Mans in 2014 is thus integrated into the 918 Spyder - and vice versa. The structural concept of the 918 Spyder with a rolling chassis as its basis - a basic vehicle that can be driven even without a body - is race car tradition at Porsche. The concept of the V8 engine originates from the LMP2 RS Spyder race car. The load-bearing structures, the monocoque and subframe, are made of carbon fiber reinforced polymer. Porsche has many years of experience with this high-strength, lightweight construction material and has again achieved top results with the development of the series production 918 Spyder. Many parts of the super sports car come from manufacturers who have a proven record as suppliers for motorsport vehicles.



	<h2> #7 Lotus Avora 400 2017</h2>

	<img src="http://hanabi.autoweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/gen-1200-675/public/lotusday1_015_0.jpg?itok=4nOgi9B1" width=60%>

<p>The Lotus Evora 400 is the fastest Lotus road car of the New Millennium. Its lightweight chassis has been lowered and widened to make cockpit entry and exit to the 2+2 composite body easy. The Evora 400 exudes the Lotus spirit of lightness and driving purity so succinctly. Despite producing 400 hp (406 ps) from its 3.5-litre supercharged V6 engine, with its comfortable cabin displaying many new features, the overall kerbweight of the Evora 400 has been reduced by 93 pounds over its forebear. As a result, its exquisite power to weight ratio, combined with an aerodynamic package that maintains zero lift but increases downforce at high speeds, simply enhances its supercar appeal.

The exquisite 3.5-litre V6 engine has been modified significantly to achieve the supercar performance of the Evora 400. Its induction system has been supplemented by a revised supercharger and a water-to-air chargecooler, that raises power to an outstanding 400 hp (406 ps). Select the first of its six, close-ratio, manual gears and the acceleration is viscerally exciting. In fact, the automatic version is even swifter off the mark, its performance sharpened by the Race setting in the Dynamic Performance Management system. A V-max of 186 mph (300 kph), experienced from within the Evora 400’s purposefully equipped and comfortable cabin, provides proof positive that Lotus makes supercar ownership not only extremely focused but also both entrancing and giant-killing.

<h2>#6 Bugatti Chiron</h2>
<img src="https://media.caranddriver.com/images/16q2/667339/2017-bugatti-chiron-25-cars-worth-waiting-for-feature-car-and-driver-photo-667699-s-450x274.jpg"
<p>Bugatti engineers are keeping the actual numbers under wraps for now; however, they will admit the Chiron will accelerate to 60 mph in less than 2.5 seconds, with 0-186 mph taking less than 15 seconds. It will do 236 mph in normal nanny mode. Insert the second, go-faster key that, as in the Veyron, sets up the car for ultra-high-speed running, lowering the ride height and reducing downforce and drag, and the Chiron will hit a computer-limited 261 mph.</p>

<h2>#5 LaFerrari Aperta</h2>
<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/782_N1TUK34/maxresdefault.jpg
"
<p>The LaFerrari Aperta is a drop-top version of the well-known LaFerrari exotic supercar, which was sold in a limited quantity (reportedly just under 500 units) a few years ago. The Aperta is even more limited, as Ferrari says they'll produce just 200 examples of the drop-top supercar -- the first time the brand has ever offered both coupe and convertible versions of its "supercar" line.
On the outside, the Aperta looks a lot like the original car, save for the fact that, well, the roof comes off. It's not a power-operated top, like in some rivals, but rather two carbon-fiber panels that have to be removed by hand. It's not the most graceful solution, but it helps save weight -- and reduce complexity.
Not that the LaFerrari is a car devoted to reducing complexity. Under the skin, you'll find a carbon-fiber chassis, a dual-clutch automatic transmission and a 6.3-liter V12 with a hybrid component that combine for a total of 950 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque. The result is zero to 60 in under 3 seconds and a top speed of nearly 220 miles per hour -- amazing numbers, even in today's world of crazy exotic cars.

	<h2>#4 BMW i8</h2>
	<img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FxvDdKhcP-s/VOrteSqcTaI/AAAAAAAAAQo/k_09pVrethc/s1600/bmw-i8-electric-blue-wallpaper-1024x557.png">
	<p>First off, the i8 offers an electric range of around 15 total miles, which isn't bad for a high-performance sports car. From there, the figures get a bit more complicated. The car offers 76 miles per gallon equivalent when you factor in the electric motor, and around 28 mpg from the gas engine alone. The total range is about 330 miles.
But while those numbers are typically associated with a fuel-sipping economy car, the i8 is anything but fuel-sipping, which becomes obvious the moment you see its low-slung and exotic styling. And it's even clearer when you look at the sporty BMW's performance figures. The i8 boasts 357 horsepower, 450 lb-ft of torque, standard all-wheel drive and a 0-to-60 time of around 4.5 seconds. Not bad for a plug-in hybrid.

<h2>#2 Lykan Hypersport</h2>
<img src="http://www.thesupercarblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lykan-Hypersport1.jpg">
<p>The custom twin-turbo flat 6 engine by Ruf produces 780 bhp, catapulting the Lykan to 240mph, passing 200 kmh on the way in just 9 seconds.

The Lykan Hypersports is without doubt the most opulent supercar on the market.
